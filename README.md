# Manual QA Practice

Hi 👋  
I’m currently learning Manual QA testing and building my skills step by step.

This repository is where I document my learning process by:
- Writing test cases
- Creating test scenarios
- Practicing smoke, sanity, and regression testing concepts
- Learning how to write clear bug reports

## How I learn
I focus on understanding QA fundamentals, application behavior, and how users interact with software.
I practice by writing realistic test cases based on real-world application scenarios.

## What you will find here
- Clear and structured test cases
- Practical testing scenarios
- Sample bug reports
- QA learning notes and examples

## Personal note
In the past, I tried learning several programming languages but didn’t always stay consistent and often stopped midway.

This time, my goal is different.
By sharing my learning process publicly, I aim to stay accountable, avoid self-sabotage, and remain consistent in my QA journey.

## Goal
To build a strong foundation in Manual QA testing and gradually move into testing real applications as I progress.
